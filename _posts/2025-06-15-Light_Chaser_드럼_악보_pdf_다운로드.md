### 가사
No I can't hide from fight  
Which seem violent and endless  
I bark and bite nameless  
To get further and higher  
So when you fall down  
You become my stairs  
I step on you head and go up  
Please don't blame me alone  
Cause it‘s only for few anyway  
falling  
Run run run run run  
till you reach the rainbow  
Climb climb climb climb climb  
Climb and stand on the moon  
Why do you chase the light  
It never get clearer nor closer  
Go back and look around  
For the light always been with us  
I cover my ears and keep my way on  
Don't call me that  
Becomes to be along  
Cause its only for few anyway  
falling  
Run run run run run  
till you reach the rainbow  
Climb climb climb climb climb  
Climb and stand on the moon  
Run run run run run  
till you reach the rainbow  
Climb climb climb climb climb  
Climb and stand on the moon  
Run run run run run  
Climb climb climb climb climb  
Run run run run run  
Climb climb climb climb climb
