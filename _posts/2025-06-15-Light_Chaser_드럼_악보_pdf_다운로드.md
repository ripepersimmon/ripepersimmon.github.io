### 가사
No I can't hide from fight
Which seem violent and endless
I bark and bite nameless
To get further and higher
So when you fall down
You become my stairs
I step on you head and go up
Please don't blame me alone
Cause it‘s only for few anyway
falling
Run run run run run
till you reach the rainbow
Climb climb climb climb climb
Climb and stand on the moon
Why do you chase the light
It never get clearer nor closer
Go back and look around
For the light always been with us
I cover my ears and keep my way on
Don't call me that
Becomes to be along
Cause its only for few anyway
falling
Run run run run run
till you reach the rainbow
Climb climb climb climb climb
Climb and stand on the moon
Run run run run run
till you reach the rainbow
Climb climb climb climb climb
Climb and stand on the moon
Run run run run run
Climb climb climb climb climb
Run run run run run
Climb climb climb climb climb
