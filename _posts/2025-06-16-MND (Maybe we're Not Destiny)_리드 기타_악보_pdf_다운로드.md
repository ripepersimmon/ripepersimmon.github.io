### 가사
I have the same dream every day  
Walking down a path side by side with you  
When I wake up from that dream  
I’m never gonna make it obvious that I think of you now  
Could you come to me?  
Could you come to me?  
I can’t focus of my work because I saw your smile  
Come to me?  
Could you come to me?  
I can’t sleep again tonight because I saw you across the street  
We’ve seen each other before  
But then my eyes lose their place  
My red cheeks are terrible,  
But my true heart will make you happy every day  
Could you come to me?  
Could you come to me?  
I can’t focus on my work because I saw you smile  
Come to me?  
Could you come to me?  
I can’t sleep again tonight because I saw you across the street  
Maybe We’re not destiny  
But we’re going to the same destination,  
Then you’ll have to come to me  
You'll come to me  
You'll come to me  
Maybe We’re not destiny  
But we’re going to the same destination,  
Then you’ll have to come to me  
You'll come to me  
You'll come to me
